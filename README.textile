h1. AS3 Image Tiler

This simple class loads a local external image (JPG, GIF, PNG, SWF) and tiles it within dimensions of your choosing.

Need some tiling images? I've amassed a collection of them over the years. They're publicly shared on Flickr at http://www.flickr.com/photos/sikelianos/sets/72157594233031615/

h2. To Do
